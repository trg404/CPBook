# authentic self


Showing vulnerability humanizes but only after you've shown your confidence. 

Authenticity through vulnerability works once credentials and competence are proven.

## Authenticity without boundaries is careless, be careful the vulnerability you show casts doubts on your competence.

Authenticity - Being Honest, being blunt. 

How other people see you isn't their problem it's yours.

## Authenticity without empathy is selfish

> be yourself unless yourself is an asshole.
David Sedaris
