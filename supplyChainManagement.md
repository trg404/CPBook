# Supply Chain Management

## Logistics

managing the movement of materials, components and information from point to point in the supply chain.

- Reverse Logistics
  - The process of returning defective products to the manufacturer for repair or replacement, and/or efforts to reuse and recycle materials
- Third Party Logistics
  - when a company uses a 3rd party to outsource their distribution, wharehousing and fullfillment services


## types of integration
- Veritcle integration
  - A company owning many steps in their supply chain.
  - Backwards 
    - Owning further back in their supply chain closer to the raw materials
  - Forward
    - Owning closer to the if not the retail side of the supply chain

- Sourcing
  - Insourcing
    - When goods and services are provided by the organization itself.
  - Outsourcing
    - When goods and services are obtained from outside suppliers



## Supply Chain Strategies

-Vendor Management Inventory
  - the vendor or supplier, can better coordinate its own production with the replenishment of supplier inventory, thus reducint cost and imporivng delivery performance between the supplier and the retailer. To make this work, the suppliers recieve daily point of sale data from the retail stores, and they also have acces to retailer's inventory files.
 
- Agile
  - The use of responsiveness, competency, flexibility, and quickness to manage how well a supply chain entity operates on a daily basis

  - Most suitable for innovative products such as cell phones and computers

  - Focus: Speed and felxibility

  - For products with short life cycles and unpredictable demand


- Lean
  - Traditional "Factory" chain, which focuses on producing high volume at low cost. The goal is to add value for customers by reducing the cost of goods and lowering waste or non value added activities. 

  - Most suitable for traditional products with minimal innovation such as curtain rods or can openers

  - Focus: Eliminate waste and low cost

  - For products with long life cycles and stable demand

## Theory of Constraints

- Constraint
  - any resource who capacity is less than or equal to demand for that resource
 
 
- Bottleneck 
  - Biggest constraing on a system or process.

A bottle neck in a supple chain occurs at the point in the process that requires the longest time or has the slowest rate. The bottleneck may be a machine, worker availability, or any other resource involved in converting inputs into outputs or products

Dr. Eliyahu Goldratt 

- Theory of Constraing 
  - a 5 step thinking process which helps a firm achieve optimal _throughput_ or the current maximum rate of output possible in the current system, by identifying the bottlenext and coordinating the system around the bottlenck's capacity. TOC also helps identify ways of overcoming the bottleneck

 
1. Identify the constraint
2. Exploit the constraint
3. Subordinate everything else to the constraint
4. Elevate the constraint
5. Don't stop now find your next constraint


- Identify
  - Find the piece that is most outside human control

- Exploit Systems Constraint
  - Is the piece that is outside of my control running as efficently as it can?

- Subordinate 
  - Communicate that the bottleneck 

- Elevate
  - Figure out an experiment to try to improve the constraint

- Don't stop
  - Check results and identify new constraint and try again.

_There will always be a bottleneck to a system_

### Other bottlenecks
* Regulatory Bottlenecks
* Labor Bottlenecks
* Technology Bottlenecks
* Decisions Making bottlenecks
* Physical bottlenecks
* Process bottlenecks
* Financial Bottlenecks

## Operational Strategies

- Competitive Advantage
  - the capability that cusomter value, such as short delivery lead time or high product quality that gives and organization an edge against it's competition.
  - Some Scholars use the acronym VIRAL
    - V alue
    - I nimitable (not easily imitated)
    - R are
    - A ptitude 
    - L ifespan

[SWOT Analysis](/swot)


- Productivity
  - Mathmatical calculatin; it is the ratio of outputs achieved divided by inputs consumed to achieve those outputs
    - As productivity increases, organizations can do the same owrk wtih less effort, or can do more work with the same effort. INcreases in productivity reduce costs, lower prices, and provide a basis for competing in world markets.
 
## Inventory
 
 Term for the good available for sale and raw material used to produce goods available for sale. Inventory can help businesses meet demand and work more efficiently
 
#### 6 types of inventory
 
- Raw Materials
  - These parts and materials are obtained from suppliers and are used in the production process
- Work In Progress (WIP) 
  - These are partly finished parts, components, subassemblies, or modules
- Finished Good
  - Items are ready to ship to the customer. No more work is required
- Replacement parts Inventory
  - these are maintained to replace other parts in machinery or equipment as those parts wear out.
- Supplies
  - Part or materials are used to support the production process but not usually a component of the product. These items, succh as lubricant and cutting tools, are consumed in the production process.
 - Transportation (Pipeline)
   - The portion of inventory that is the process of being shipped through the distribution system

#### 4 types of Demand

- Peak Demand
  - which occuer in response to planned events such as advertising, publicity, or promotion. The release of a popular game frnachise's latest version often casues peak demand for a few days or weeks.
- Seasonal Demand
  - as shoppers adjust their purchase velocity in line with holidays, especially christmans. But Halloween, thanksgiving and even, St. Patricks day also create seasonal demand for certain kinds of merchandise
- Unexpected Demand
  - which occurs due to a usually-unexpected event. for example and underdog school may upset a favorite during the NCAA's basketball tournament, causing a run on their merchandise
- Chase Demand
  - occurse whena  company has to adjust production by rates to match demand by varying the workforse and using overtime. Companies vary the workforce by adding or reducig the number of employees on duty at any given time. And they may choose to provide overtime by asking worked to stay on the job beyond their normally scheduled time.

Many firms keep a cushion of _safety stock_ of inventory to protect against unexpected demant. In this way they can continue to meet customer demands without delays, a _stock out_ occurts when inventory is depleted this may occur for a variety of reasons. 

#### Perpetual and Periodic Inventory systems

systems that companies use to track inventory. Although mostly used seperately they can also be used together.

- Perpetual Inventory system
  - continuously monitors invnetory levels and is also called continuous review system. Requires human input (I.E. Cashier) and the ordering of more inventory is triggered by reorder point.
- Periodic Inventory System
  - randomly monitors inventory levels and is also called the fixed order invertal system. not expensive to implement or maintain.


- ABC Analysis
  - developeed to determine whcih inventory items shoudl recieve the highest level of control. By multiplying the dollar value of each item by it's annual usage, a dollar usage value can be obtained. Dollar usage follows the _Pareto Principle_ in that frequently only 20% of all items account for 80% of the total dollar usage, while the remianing items frequently account for only 20% of the dollar usage. This principle leads to the ABC calssification, which is based on focusing efforts where the payoff is the highest. 
    
#### EOQ (Economic Order Quantity) vs EPQ (Economic Production Quantity)

two models used to help companies control the cost of ordering, recieving, and holding inventory

- EOQ
  - inventory that doesn't require production
  - when demand is constant and known
  - when cost per unit does not depend on order quantity
  - most appropriate for retail stores or companies that order finished goods.
- EPQ
  - For inventory that will be used in production
  - when incremental ordering and depletion of inventory is allowed
  - also caled production order quantity
  - most appropriate for manufactoring and production companies.

The goal of firms using the EOQ & EPQ model is to minimize the total annual cost of odering and holding inventory by varrying the order quanitity. Ordering cost and holding cost can be described with the analogy of two children sitting on a seesaw. when one goes up the other goes down and vice versa. Although it costs money to replenish inventory, it also costs money to hold that inventory. Such inventory holding costs also called carrying costs, may include costs paid for storage space, interest paid on borrowed money to finance the inventory, and losses incurred due to damaage or obsolensence.

- Quantity Discount Model
  - A discount offered in price for ordering above a specified amount
- Transportation discounts
  - a discount offered on shipping cost for ordering above a specified amount
- Revenue Sharing
  - when 2 or more companies partner and divides the profits recieved based on an agreement between all parties involved.
- Reserve Capacity
  - When a company stores, or pays another company to store, excess inventroy to be used for unexpected demand


## Qualitiy Management 

- The degree to which a specific product conforms to it's design characteristics or specifications
- The amount of a specific, desired attribute
- the capacity to satisfy customer needs
- consistently meeting or exceeding the customer's needs and expectations
- is everyone's responsibility in the organization


- Internal Orientation of Quality
  - Directly measure characteristics of the product or service, such as the number of packages delivered on time or the thickness of an engine part based on manufacturers specifications
- External Orientation of Quality
  - Fitness for use for the customer or the capacity to satisfy customer's needs

- Quality Function Deployment (QFD)
  - taking customer expectations and transforming them into specific actions designed to meet those expectations

#### Service Quality
Fivce dimensions are often used by customers to judge service quality. Understanding these dimendsions helps firms to define quality and determind what steps are needed to improve quality

- Reliability
  - Ability to perform the promised service dependable and accurately
- Responsiveness 
  - willingness to help customers and provide prompt service 
- Assurance 
  - knowledge and courtesy of employees and their ability to convey trsut and confidence
- Empathy
  - provision of caring, individualized attention to customers
- Tangibles
  - appearance of physical facilities, equipment, personnel, and communication materials, including access and effectiveness of internet based information


#### Quality of Goods

In examining the dimensions of quality for goods, it is important to recall that a good is tangible and therefore, direct contact between the customer and the employees who make the good does not often occur, as a result, the factors that comprise the quality of the good are quite differen from the factors that comprise the quality service

- Performance
  - Primary Operating chracteristic of a product
- Features
  - Secondary chracteristic that supplement the products basic functioning
- Reliability
  - lenght of time the product will functin before it fails, or the probability it will function for a stated period of time
- conformance 
  - degree to whcih a product's design and operation chracteristics math pre-established standards
- Durability
  - ability of a product to function when subjected to hard and frequent use. 
- serviceability 
  - speed, coutesy, and competence of repair. 
- Aesthetics
  - how a product looks, feels, sounds, tastes, or smells
- Percieved Quality
  - image, advertising, or brand name of a product

#### Costs of Quality

- Failture Costs 
  - Can be internal to the organization ro external involving the customers
- Appraisal costs
  - investment in measure quality and assessing customer satisfaction
- Prevention Cost
  - Put a stop to the quality problem


## Philosophies of Quality management

[Phiilip B. Crosby](/crosby)

[Joseph M. Juran](/juran)

[Genichi Taguchi](/taguchi)

[Edward Demming](/demming)

[Kaoru Ishikawa](/ishikawa)

- Statistical Process Control
  - the use of statistical methods to determine whena  process that produces a g
ood or service is getting close to producing and unacceptable level of defects.
In a broader sense, SPC relates to the set of tips, techniques, and tools use to
 monitor variations in a process, determine the stability of a process, and redu
ce or eliminate variations that result in non-conforming products that are eithe
r defective or do not meet customer's specifications.

#### 7 basic tools of SPC 

1. Cause and effect Diagrams or Fishbone Diagrams
  - Show the impact of various inputs into the results of a process. They help organizations isolate the root casues of problems such as bottlenecks in their process
2. Check Sheets
  - Are the means used to record data point in real time at the site wher ethe data is generated. This is often the first tool used to asses a process and often the data is raw meaning it is straight form the source without any interpretation.
3. Control Charts
  - are graphical depictions of process outputs where the raw data is plotted in real time with upper (UCL) and lower limits (LCL) as each data point is collected, it is recorded on the control chart in relation to the processs mean and the UCL and LCL. In this way, the process operator can instantly determine whether the process is stable or trending toward instability and take corrective action before variations result in non-conforming products.
4. Run Charts
  - Another form of control chart plotted in real time for processes that might have common features, a common scale, or some form of central tendency
5. Histogram
  - demonstrate frequency of data observations within a preset range of values. The data is continuously collected and each data vlue will match one of the preset range of values.
6. Pareto Charts
  - represents data values in a descending order to visualize the most frequent occurances. The difference from a histograpm is that Pareto charts always rflect the data in descending order to emphasize the most common occurnace among the data points. 
7. Scotter Plot
  - Displays data as a relationship to show the correlatino between two variables. The correlation will show a positive, negative or no relationship at all.

## Capacity Planning

- Capacity
  - is a measure of an organizations ability to sustainably provide customers with the deamnded services or goods in the amount requested and in a timely manner, given current resources. Capacity also describes an organizations maximum sustainable rate of production
  - Capacity Plannign
    - Is need to support customer deman and maintain produciton capacity as demands for products change.

#### Capacity Planning 

- Lead 
  - adds capacity with the aniticipation of an increase in demand. This strategy is considered aggresive and is primarily used in an effort to obtain customer from competitors by reducing theamount of lead time and improving service levsl. using this strategy ensures adequate capacity is available to mee all demands during high growth periods. 

- Lag
  - Adds capacity only after an organization is running at full capacity or is beyong due to increase in demand. This is the oppostie of lead capacity strategy.
 
- Match
  - Adds capacity in small incremental amounts in response to changing demadns in the market

- Adjustment 
  - adds or reduce capacity in small or large amounts as consumer demand changes; triggered by major changes to process or system.
 
#### Layouts

- _Product_ Oriented Layout
  - characterized by high demand for the smae or similar products.
  - Also called Sequential Layout
- _Process_ Oriented Layout
  - Characterized by the produciton of many different products with the same equipment and low volume of any individual product.
  - Also caleld funcitonal layout

- Design Capacity
  - The maximum achievable output of a procees or system
- Effective Capacity
  - is the maximum capacicty given the product mix, equipment changeovers, and scheduled downtime of the production schedule. 
  - always _less_ than deisgn capacity
- Actual Output
  - total amount of produced during a given time period.

##### Capacity Utilization

A metric or measure, used to determine how much capacity is acutally being used on an average basis. 
```
Capacity Utilization = Actual output / Design Capacity
```


##### Efficiency rate

A metric, or measure, used ot determine how much effective capacity is actualyl being used to achieve output

```
Efficency = Actual Output / Effective Capacity
```

### Role of facility Location

the placement of a facility with regard to a company's custoerms, suppliers, and other facilities with which the company interacts based on quantitative and qualitative factors. Quantitative factors are easily measureable and are usualy assigne da numerical value, while qualitative factors are more subjective and are usually not enumerated.

- Regional Strategy
  - requires that each production facility has defined marketing area and each facility produces a complete line of products for tha area. this is often done when customer convenience and access are important, or when outbound transportation costs are very high.

- Product Facility Strategy
  - means that one facility is responsible for producing one product or product line and shipping that product throughout the country and the world this apporach is appropriate when the production process is complex and hard to control, such as making ceramic heat shield for spacecraft.


```
TC = VC(x) + FC
```
- TC
  - Total Costs
    - consists of fixed costs and variable costs.
- VC
  - Variable Costs
    - those which change and can be adjusted as business conditions change
- FC
  - Fixed Costs
    - those which remain the same in all business conditions
- x
  - Number of units


### Foundations of Process Selection

Determining the most appropriate method of complete a task

- Assembly Line
  - process selection most appropriate to produce high volume with little to no variation. Uses product facility layout (i.e. car manufacturer)
- Continuous Flow
  - Process selection most appropriate to produce high volumen with no variation. sues product facility layout (i.e. Oil Refinery) 
   - Also called Continuous inventory flow
- Batch flow
  - process selectin most appropriate to produce high volume with some variation. uses product facility layout: requreis equipment or tool changes
- Job Shop
  - Process slection most appropriate to produce low volume with little to high variation. uses process facility layout (i.e. Customized furniture) 


- Economies of scale
  - is the ability to produce more goods at a lower cost by better utilizing the same fixed costs
- Economies of Scope
  - Can be express as "economies of scale through product line diversificatoin" it implies building the volume necessary to cover fixed costs by producing a variety of products on the same equipment. This requires flexibility within the organization.



### Master Production Schedule

- Forecasting
  - the process of making prediciotns of the future based on past and present data and most commonly by analysis of trends.
  - Steps include
    - Determine the objectives of the forecast
    - Develop and test model
    - Apply the model
      - Consider real-world constraints on the model's application
 

- Independent Demand
  - items usually include finished products, such as the completed tricycle or replacement parts sold to customers
- Dependent Demand
  - Deamnd for ana item that is generated by a company's production process
- Bill of Materials 
  - lists of materials needed and the quantites of each

#### application of models

- Qualitative methods
  - forecasting techniques are subjective, based on the opinion and judgement of consumers and experts. They are appropriate when past data are not available. Most suitable for new products or products without historical data.
  - Buildup method
    - Starting at the bottom of the organization and owrking to the top to solicit info to determine forecast
  - Survey method
    - using questionaires, phone interviews, or the internet to solicit info to determine forecast
  - Test Markets
    - Conducting a trail run with the prodcut in a market region to determine forecast
  - Pannel of Experts (Delphi Technique) 
    - soliciting info from people who are knowledgeable about the subject being considered to determine forecast

- Quantatative methods (time series)
  - forecasting technique using historical data to predict future. They are appropriate to use when past numerical data is available and when it is reasonable to assume that some of the patterns in the data are expected to continue inot the future.
  - Simple Moving Average
    - Apple a simple average based on a specific time period
  - Weighted moving average
    - applying a simple average based on a specific time period with assigned weights to each.


- Medium range forecasts (operations planning)
  - forecasts and operation planning that typically extends 6 to 18 months into the future
- Long range operations planning
  - planning for facility location, technologies, and capacity that typically extends 5 to 10 years
- Aggregate planning
  - is the combining of individual end items into groups or families of parts for planning purposes


- The master Schedule (Master Production Schedule MPS)
  - based on the aggregate plan. The master production schedule "disaggregates the aggregate plan" because it is a specific statement of exactly what will be produced and a specific date for production. The master production schedule usually states the individual end items or product models. 
   - The master schedule planning horizon is as long as the cumulative lead time of the product or product with the longest lead time. The MPS is usually between 12 and 16 weeks.

MPS Inputs
- Demand forecast
- Inventory Levels
- Customer Orders
- Production Capacity
- Inventoy / Production Costs


MPS Outputs
- Quantity to be produced
- Staffing needs
- ATP or Available to promise
  - this is inventory that has not been sold but can be "promised" to customers if an order is placed
- Project available balance
  - inventory levels after the production period

- Time Fences
  - boundaries between periods in the planning horizon
  - Time-Bucket
    - is a period of time, usually one week, in which demand and requirements are grouped for master scheduling and materials requirements planning.
- Lead time
  - the amount of time it takes to plan, produce, and deliver a product

### Material Requirements Planning (MRP)

MRP is a computerized informaiton system used for planning and manageing inventory for dependent demand items. 

##### Inputs
- Master Schedule File
- Bill of Material File
- Inventory File


###### MRP vs MRP II

- MRP 
  - deals with getting the right amount of raw materisl to the right place at the right time to support production.
  - systematically designed to plan for production and deliver product
  - includes Master Schedule, Bill of Materials and Inventory files
  - MRP is widely considered to stop when material are recieved.
- MPR II
  - often called _manufactuing resource plannin_ builds on the foundation of MRP
  - also includes production planning, machine capacity scheduling, demaand forecasting and analysis and quality tracking tools into the mix
  - Also features tools for tracking employee attendance, service and maintenance, and transportation
- ERP (Enterprise Resource Planning 
  - more robust data driven system that stems from MRP II 
  - used when all corporate data needs to be accessible to all employees


## Operating Efficiency

### Just In Time 

Manufacturing methodoloy aimed primarily at reducing flow times within prodcution systems as well as response times from suppliers and to customers by recieving ordering and recievening inventory when ready for use or just in time for use. 

Fundamental concepts include

- JIT allows materials to flow in an assembly process similar to a continous flow process
- uses general purpose machinery
- produce in small batches or small lot sizes
- uses a pull system
- uses process facility layout
- simplifies the production process by
  - reducing set up times
  - having workers in close proximity
  - using total preventive maintenance (preventing machinery breakdowns)
- uses Kanban cards
- Produces in smaller batches and shorter planning horizons (2-3 months instead of 6-12)


Just in time II (JIT II)
- relationship with suppliers are further strengthened beyond vendoer managed inventory in which the supplier places a representatvie on the customers site that is dedicated to the customers products only. Although an employee of the supplier, this person is autheroized to purchase material for the customer.

- Push system 
  - moves materials thorugh the processing operaiotn based on a schedule. uses a master scheudle to plan builds out in time, and parts (raw materials, subassemblies, etc.) are ordered based on this build plan.

- Pull System 
  - moves materials through a system to work stations as they are needed. Daily builds are scheduled only when there are orders for the products.

- value stream mapping 
  - is a technique used to analyze the flow of materials, ideas, and information to understand how processes funciton. Each activity in the process is defined as value addd or non-value added 


- Group Technology (gt) prodcution system
  - each part follows the same essentail processing sequence. By Keeping similar parts together teh setupd time is reduced, and the flow of materials is not interupted. If excessive time is taken for the setup, then the flow of material will be stopped causing downstream processing operations to pause until the flow resumes. If "upstream" operations continue unchecked, unnecesary inventoy will build up in the system, much as water builds up whena  dam is placed accross a river
