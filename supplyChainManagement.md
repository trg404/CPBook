# Supply Chain Management

## types of integration
- Veritcle integration
  - A company owning many steps in their supply chain.
  - Backwards 
    - Owning further back in their supply chain closer to the raw materials
  - Forward
    - Owning closer to the if not the retail side of the supply chain


## types of supply chains

- Agile
  - The use of responsiveness, competency, flexibility, and quickness to manage how well a supply chain entity operates on a daily basis

  - Most suitable for innovative products such as cell phones and computers

  - Focus: Speed and felxibility

  - For products with short life cycles and unpredictable demand


- Lean
  - Traditional "Factory" chain, which focuses on producing high volume at low cost. The goal is to add value for customers by reducing the cost of goods and lowering waste or non value added activities. 

  - Most suitable for traditional products with minimal innovation such as curtain rods or can openers

  - Focus: Eliminate waste and low cost

  - For products with long life cycles and stable demand

## Theory of Constraints

- Bottleneck 
  - Biggest constraing on a system or process.

A bottle neck in a supple chain occurs at the point in the process that requires the longest time or has the slowest rate. The bottleneck may be a machine, worker availability, or any other resource involved in converting inputs into outputs or products

Dr. Eliyahu Goldratt 

- Theory of Constraing 
  - a 5 step thinking process which helps a firm achieve optimal _throughput_ or the current maximum rate of output possible in the current system, by identifying the bottlenext and coordinating the system around the bottlenck's capacity. TOC also helps identify ways of overcoming the bottleneck

 
1. Identify the constraint
2. Exploit the constraint
3. Subordinate everything else to the constraint
4. Elevate the constraint
5. Don't stop now find your next constraint


- Identify
  - Find the piece that is most outside human control

- Exploit Systems Constraint
  - Is the piece that is outside of my control running as efficently as it can?

- Subordinate 
  - Communicate that the bottleneck 

- Elevate
  - Figure out an experiment to try to improve the constraint

- Don't stop
  - Check results and identify new constraint and try again.

_There will always be a bottleneck to a system_

### Other bottlenecks
* Regulatory Bottlenecks
* Labor Bottlenecks
* Technology Bottlenecks
* Decisions Making bottlenecks
* Physical bottlenecks
* Process bottlenecks
* Financial Bottlenecks

## Operational Strategies

- Competitive Advantage
  - the capability that cusomter value, such as short delivery lead time or high product quality that gives and organization an edge against it's competition.
  - Some Scholars use the acronym VIRAL
    - V alue
    - I nimitable (not easily imitated)
    - R are
    - A ptitude 
    - L ifespan

- Productivity
  - Mathmatical calculatin; it is the ratio of outputs achieved divided by inputs consumed to achieve those outputs
    - As productivity increases, organizations can do the same owrk wtih less effort, or can do more work with the same effort. INcreases in productivity reduce costs, lower prices, and provide a basis for competing in world markets.
 
## Inventory
 
 Term for the good available for sale and raw material used to produce goods available for sale. Inventory can help businesses meet demand and work more efficiently
 
#### 6 types of inventory
 
- Raw Materials
  - These parts and materials are obtained from suppliers and are used in the production process
- Work In Progress (WIP) 
  - These are partly finished parts, components, subassemblies, or modules
- Finished Good
  - Items are ready to ship to the customer. No more work is required
- Replacement parts Inventory
  - these are maintained to replace other parts in machinery or equipment as those parts wear out.
- Supplies
  - Part or materials are used to support the production process but not usually a component of the product. These items, succh as lubricant and cutting tools, are consumed in the production process.
 - Transportation (Pipeline)
   - The portion of inventory that is the process of being shipped through the distribution system

#### 4 types of Demand

- Peak Demand
  - which occuer in response to planned events such as advertising, publicity, or promotion. The release of a popular game frnachise's latest version often casues peak demand for a few days or weeks.
- Seasonal Demand
  - as shoppers adjust their purchase velocity in line with holidays, especially christmans. But Halloween, thanksgiving and even, St. Patricks day also create seasonal demand for certain kinds of merchandise
- Unexpected Demand
  - which occurs due to a usually-unexpected event. for example and underdog school may upset a favorite during the NCAA's basketball tournament, causing a run on their merchandise
- Chase Demand
  - occurse whena  company has to adjust production by rates to match demand by varying the workforse and using overtime. Companies vary the workforce by adding or reducig the number of employees on duty at any given time. And they may choose to provide overtime by asking worked to stay on the job beyond their normally scheduled time.

Many firms keep a cushion of _safety stock_ of inventory to protect against unexpected demant. In this way they can continue to meet customer demands without delays, a _stock out_ occurts when inventory is depleted this may occur for a variety of reasons. 

#### Perpetual and Periodic Inventory systems

systems that companies use to track inventory. Although mostly used seperately they can also be used together.

- Perpetual Inventory system
  - continuously monitors invnetory levels and is also called continuous review system. Requires human input (I.E. Cashier) and the ordering of more inventory is triggered by reorder point.
- Periodic Inventory System
  - randomly monitors inventory levels and is also called the fixed order invertal system. not expensive to implement or maintain.


- ABC Analysis
  - developeed to determine whcih inventory items shoudl recieve the highest level of control. By multiplying the dollar value of each item by it's annual usage, a dollar usage value can be obtained. Dollar usage follows the _Pareto Principle_ in that frequently only 20% of all items account for 80% of the total dollar usage, while the remianing items frequently account for only 20% of the dollar usage. This principle leads to the ABC calssification, which is based on focusing efforts where the payoff is the highest. 
    
#### EOQ (Economic Order Quantity) vs EPQ (Economic Production Quantity)

two models used to help companies control the cost of ordering, recieving, and holding inventory

- EOQ
  - inventory that doesn't require production
  - when demand is constant and known
  - when cost per unit does not depend on order quantity
  - most appropriate for retail stores or companies that order finished goods.
- EPQ
  - For inventory that will be used in production
  - when incremental ordering and depletion of inventory is allowed
  - also caled production order quantity
  - most appropriate for manufactoring and production companies.

The goal of firms using the EOQ & EPQ model is to minimize the total annual cost of odering and holding inventory by varrying the order quanitity. Ordering cost and holding cost can be described with the analogy of two children sitting on a seesaw. when one goes up the other goes down and vice versa. Although it costs money to replenish inventory, it also costs money to hold that inventory. Such inventory holding costs also called carrying costs, may include costs paid for storage space, interest paid on borrowed money to finance the inventory, and losses incurred due to damaage or obsolensence.

- Quantity Discount Model
  - A discount offered in price for ordering above a specified amount
- Transportation discounts
  - a discount offered on shipping cost for ordering above a specified amount
- Revenue Sharing
  - when 2 or more companies partner and divides the profits recieved based on an agreement between all parties involved.
- Reserve Capacity
  - When a company stores, or pays another company to store, excess inventroy to be used for unexpected demand


## Qualitiy Management 

- The degree to which a specific product conforms to it's design characteristics or specifications
- The amount of a specific, desired attribute
- the capacity to satisfy customer needs
- consistently meeting or exceeding the customer's needs and expectations
- is everyone's responsibility in the organization


- Internal Orientation of Quality
  - Directly measure characteristics of the product or service, such as the number of packages delivered on time or the thickness of an engine part based on manufacturers specifications
- External Orientation of Quality
  - Fitness for use for the customer or the capacity to satisfy customer's needs

- Quality Function Deployment (QFD)
  - taking customer expectations and transforming them into specific actions designed to meet those expectations

#### Service Quality
Fivce dimensions are often used by customers to judge service quality. Understanding these dimendsions helps firms to define quality and determind what steps are needed to improve quality

- Reliability
  - Ability to perform the promised service dependable and accurately
- Responsiveness 
  - willingness to help customers and provide prompt service 
- Assurance 
  - knowledge and courtesy of employees and their ability to convey trsut and confidence
- Empathy
  - provision of caring, individualized attention to customers
- Tangibles
  - appearance of physical facilities, equipment, personnel, and communication materials, including access and effectiveness of internet based information


#### Quality of Goods

In examining the dimensions of quality for goods, it is important to recall that a good is tangible and therefore, direct contact between the customer and the employees who make the good does not often occur, as a result, the factors that comprise the quality of the good are quite differen from the factors that comprise the quality service

- Performance
  - Primary Operating chracteristic of a product
- Features
  - Secondary chracteristic that supplement the products basic functioning
- Reliability
  - lenght of time the product will functin before it fails, or the probability it will function for a stated period of time
- conformance 
  - degree to whcih a product's design and operation chracteristics math pre-established standards
- Durability
  - ability of a product to function when subjected to hard and frequent use. 
- serviceability 
  - speed, coutesy, and competence of repair. 
- Aesthetics
  - how a product looks, feels, sounds, tastes, or smells
- Percieved Quality
  - image, advertising, or brand name of a product

#### Costs of Quality

- Failture Costs 
  - Can be internal to the organization ro external involving the customers
- Appraisal costs
  - investment in measure quality and assessing customer satisfaction
- Prevention Cost
  - Put a stop to the quality problem


## Philosophies of Quality management

[Phiilip B. Crosby](/crosby)

[Joseph M. Juran](/juran)

[Genichi Taguchi](/taguchi)

[Edward Demming](/demming)

[Kaoru Ishikawa](/ishikawa)

- Statistical Process Control
  - the use of statistical methods to determine whena  process that produces a g
ood or service is getting close to producing and unacceptable level of defects.
In a broader sense, SPC relates to the set of tips, techniques, and tools use to
 monitor variations in a process, determine the stability of a process, and redu
ce or eliminate variations that result in non-conforming products that are eithe
r defective or do not meet customer's specifications.

#### 7 basic tools of SPC 

1. Cause and effect Diagrams or Fishbone Diagrams
  - Show the impact of various inputs into the results of a process. They help organizations isolate the root casues of problems such as bottlenecks in their process
2. Check Sheets
  - Are the means used to record data point in real time at the site wher ethe data is generated. This is often the first tool used to asses a process and often the data is raw meaning it is straight form the source without any interpretation.
3. Control Charts
  - are graphical depictions of process outputs where the raw data is plotted in real time with upper (UCL) and lower limits (LCL) as each data point is collected, it is recorded on the control chart in relation to the processs mean and the UCL and LCL. In this way, the process operator can instantly determine whether the process is stable or trending toward instability and take corrective action before variations result in non-conforming products.
4. Run Charts
  - Another form of control chart plotted in real time for processes that might have common features, a common scale, or some form of central tendency
5. Histogram
  - demonstrate frequency of data observations within a preset range of values. The data is continuously collected and each data vlue will match one of the preset range of values.
6. Pareto Charts
  - represents data values in a descending order to visualize the most frequent occurances. The difference from a histograpm is that Pareto charts always rflect the data in descending order to emphasize the most common occurnace among the data points. 
7. Scotter Plot
  - Displays data as a relationship to show the correlatino between two variables. The correlation will show a positive, negative or no relationship at all.
