# Supply Chain Management

## types of integration
- Veritcle integration
  - A company owning many steps in their supply chain.
  - Backwards 
    - Owning further back in their supply chain closer to the raw materials
  - Forward
    - Owning closer to the if not the retail side of the supply chain


## types of supply chains

- Agile
  - The use of responsiveness, competency, flexibility, and quickness to manage how well a supply chain entity operates on a daily basis

  - Most suitable for innovative products such as cell phones and computers

  - Focus: Speed and felxibility

  - For products with short life cycles and unpredictable demand


- Lean
  - Traditional "Factory" chain, which focuses on producing high volume at low cost. The goal is to add value for customers by reducing the cost of goods and lowering waste or non value added activities. 

  - Most suitable for traditional products with minimal innovation such as curtain rods or can openers

  - Focus: Eliminate waste and low cost

  - For products with long life cycles and stable demand

## Theory of Constraints

- Bottleneck 
  - Biggest constraing on a system or process.

A bottle neck in a supple chain occurs at the point in the process that requires the longest time or has the slowest rate. The bottleneck may be a machine, worker availability, or any other resource involved in converting inputs into outputs or products

Dr. Eliyahu Goldratt 

- Theory of Constraing 
  - a 5 step thinking process which helps a firm achieve optimal _throughput_ or the current maximum rate of output possible in the current system, by identifying the bottlenext and coordinating the system around the bottlenck's capacity. TOC also helps identify ways of overcoming the bottleneck

 
1. Identify the constraint
2. Exploit the constraint
3. Subordinate everything else to the constraint
4. Elevate the constraint
5. Don't stop now find your next constraint


- Identify
  - Find the piece that is most outside human control

- Exploit Systems Constraint
  - Is the piece that is outside of my control running as efficently as it can?

- Subordinate 
  - Communicate that the bottleneck 

- Elevate
  - Figure out an experiment to try to improve the constraint

- Don't stop
  - Check results and identify new constraint and try again.

_There will always be a bottleneck to a system_

### Other bottlenecks
* Regulatory Bottlenecks
* Labor Bottlenecks
* Technology Bottlenecks
* Decisions Making bottlenecks
* Physical bottlenecks
* Process bottlenecks
* Financial Bottlenecks

## Operational Strategies

- Competitive Advantage
  - the capability that cusomter value, such as short delivery lead time or high product quality that gives and organization an edge against it's competition.
  - Some Scholars use the acronym VIRAL
    - V alue
    - I nimitable (not easily imitated)
    - R are
    - A ptitude 
    - L ifespan
