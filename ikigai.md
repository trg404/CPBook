Change mindset and circumstnce

1. Something we are good at
2. something we love to do
3. the world should need it
4. we should get paid


## Doing what we're good at

Focus on things that we're naturally good at so as not to waste time on things that you're only going to become mediocre at.

## Something we love to do

Chagne the mindset of doing the unloved tasks or try to outsource them. 

## World should need it

the world should be benefited from what you do. 
Otherwise it's a passion.


## get paid

Without pay this means it's a hobby.
Money as a form of energy to push towards a goal.


Love and good - Passion
Love and Need - Mission
Paid and Need - Vocation
Good and Paid - Profession


This is what you're looking for in the Ikigai. 
Wu Wei - effortless action
