# Dupont Equation

[Dupont Equation Wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DuPont_analysis)

It breaks down the Return on Equity of a given project and you can compare them together.

ROE= Profit Margin X Asset Turnover X Equity Multiplyer


Profit Margin = Net Proft / Sales

Asset Turnover = Sales / Average Total Assets

Equity Multiplier = Average total Assets / Average Equity



Regularly ROE = Net Income / Shareholder Equity
This is different than return on Investment
ROI = Net Profit / Total Investment
