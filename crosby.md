# Phillip Crosby

Came up with the idea of Do it right the first time (DRIFT) 

also started 
1. the Definition of quality is confromance to requirements (Requirements meaning both the product and the customer's requirements)
2. The system of Qualit is Prevention
3. The performance standard is zero defects (Relative to requirements)
4. the measurement of quality is the price of nonconformance
