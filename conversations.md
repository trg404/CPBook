#Conversations


There are generally four different catagories that conversations fall into. 
[Types of conversations](https://medium.com/@DavidWAngel/the-four-types-of-conversations-debate-dialogue-discourse-and-diatribe-898d19eccc0a)
This article is a bit awkward with their terms while trying to keep all their terms with the Letter D but they still work out well.

The following are the terms I'll use instead of the articles.

Dialogue- Conversation

Debate- Argue or Sell

Discourse- Information Radiation

Diatribe - Emotional Venting


I've found that https://www.vitalsmarts.com has a great over view of the breakdown of an effective conversation. I'm a particular fan of [Crucial Conversations}(crucialConversations) it breaks down conversaitons into 9 steps. 

1. [Get Unstuck](conversationStep1)
2. [Start with Heart](conversationStep2)
3. [Master my Story](conversationStep3)
4. [Describe the Gap](conversationStep4)
5. [Make it Safe](conversationStep5)
6. [Diagnose](conversationStep6)
7. [Make it Easy](conversationStep7)
8. [Make it Motivating](conversationstep8)
9. [Move to Action](conversationStep9)
