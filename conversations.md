# Conversations


I've found that https://www.vitalsmarts.com has a great over view of the breakdown of an effective conversation. I'm a particular fan of [Crucial Conversations}(crucialConversations) it breaks down conversaitons into 9 steps. 

In each of the sub catagories I've found other books delve deeper. These steps are always tackled but the other books deep dive on a certain number and glooss over the rest. Crucial Conversations does a good high level but doesn't really delve into the deeper parts of any of them.


1. [Get Unstuck](conversationStep1)
2. [Start with Heart](conversationStep2)
3. [Master my Story](conversationStep3)
4. [Describe the Gap](conversationStep4)
5. [Make it Safe](conversationStep5)
6. [Diagnose](conversationStep6)
7. [Make it Easy](conversationStep7)
8. [Make it Motivating](conversationstep8)
9. [Move to Action](conversationStep9)
