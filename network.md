# network and security


## Lesson 1

- Protocol
  - Set of rules established for users to exchange information.


### Network Topologies
#### Physical Topologies
- *Types*
  - Star
    - All computers are connected to one switch or hub. 
  - Ring
    - All computers are connected to two others in a giant circle, usually done in dual rings these days
  - Bus
    - computers form a line with one coax running between them. they include breaks and terminators
  - Mesh
    - all computers are directly connect to every other computer
      - Full mesh all connects to all
        - n(n-1) / 2 formula to figure out how many conections you need. 
      - Partial Mesh they only connect to some.


#### Logical Topology


Which kind of cable?
- Crossover Cable
  - Same Same (same kind of devices)
  - crossover - same same - Router
- STUD
  - Straight through unlike devices
  - Not the same kind of device


### OSI Model

### Ethernet LAN

### Home Networking

### Assembling Office LAN

### testing and troubleshooting LAN
