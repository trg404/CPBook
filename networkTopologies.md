# Network Topologies
## Physical Topologies
- *Types*
  - Star
    - All computers are connected to one switch or hub.
  - Ring
    - All computers are connected to two others in a giant circle, usually done in dual rings these days
  - Bus
    - computers form a line with one coax running between them. they include breaks and terminators
  - Mesh
    - all computers are directly connect to every other computer
      - Full mesh all connects to all
        - n(n-1) / 2 formula to figure out how many conections you need.
      - Partial Mesh they only connect to some.

## Logical Topology
How information in a network flows.
