# three sieves

a quaker story sometimes attributed to socrates about what questions you should ask yourself before you tell some information.

1. Is it True? 
2. Is it Kind?
3. It is Neccesary?



my version of the story

Long ago but not at the beginning, all the gods on the earth started having children, and while they were good parents they were still themselves. So being a daughter of anansi the trickiest and most cunning of the gods was a labor.  She was raised on stories true and lie that would bring her both joy and woe. After a time she got tired of her fathers endless stories and was only interested in the truth so she started to spin webs.
They weren’t to catch flies or bugs but to catch information she didn’t want. She made the first one with line so thin that no big tales could get through only things true that people had seen themselves could get through. The second web she made with webbing so bright anything unkind or dark would burn up and never make it through. The third web was built so sturdy anything they wasn’t absolutely necessary would just fall off to the ground. And at the end of these webs she sat and listened for stories from near and far cause with that knowledge she could make wise decision and no longer be prey to her fathers trickery.
