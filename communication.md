#communication

Communicaiton is conveying information from one person to another entity or person.

There are generally four different catagories that conversations fall into.

[Types of conversations](https://medium.com/@DavidWAngel/the-four-types-of-conversations-debate-dialogue-discourse-and-diatribe-898d19eccc0a)

This article is a bit awkward with their terms while trying to keep all their terms with the Letter D but they still work out well.

The following are the terms I'll use instead of the articles.

Dialogue- Conversation

Debate- Influence

Discourse- Information Radiation

Diatribe - Emotional Venting


[Conversation](/conversation) - Is working with another person to garner infomration and or create a future action
