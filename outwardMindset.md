The first part of the book talks about making sure your mindset is focused on helping others and not yourself. The basis is pure altruism.

Then you work your way up creating a relationship with those that know the person, then the person themselves, then you can watch and learn then you ask questions, then you can teach and communicate, then at the top there is correct. 

I love that it builds up to correction.
