# six sigma

A continuous imporvemtn strategy that relates to the firm's ability to produce error free products.
- specifically 3.4 defects per 1 million unts
- the main mehtodology of six sigma is five steps
  - Define
  - Measure
  - Analyze
  - Improve
  - Control


1. Define
  - Define the problem or improvement opportunity 
    - Project Charter 
      - The charter includes the scope of the project, the problem statement, time frame, boundaries, and team members
    - Voice of the Customer (VOC)
      - Feedback regarding characteristics that are critical for satisfaction of the customer
    - Value stream mapping
      - overview of an entire process, from begining to end, with regard tot he VOC, and identifying what is required to mee the customer's needs, A SIPOC chart defines the Supplier-Input-Process-Output-Custoemr relationship in a process.
2. Measure
  - Measuring the current state or 'as is', process perfomance is accomplished with a process map of the activities perfromed at each step of the process. Each step is assessed to determine the ability to meet customer specifications in a capability analysis
3. Analyze 
   - Charts and diagrams are used to visualize the measurements and the frequency of the prblems or defects, including scatter plots, pareto charts, histograms and run charts. the main objective of the analysis phase is to determine the root cause of variation in the process that result in failurs or defects.
4. Impove
  - Current process is chagned by addressing the root causes identified to improve process performance through simulations, or in realt time through desing of experiments (DOE). Improvements are often made through kazen teams.
  - Kaizen
    - an event to dsicuss process improvements opportunities using ideas from people who are directly invovled in the process
5. Control
  - maintaining standardizing the improved performance through a control plan to document the requirements to reduce process variation. Another tool for control is the 5s methodology.
  - 5s Methodology
    - Sort
    - Striaghten
    - Shine
    - Standardize
    - Sustain

## DMADV process

specifically used for new products also known as Desing for six sigma (DFSS)

- Total Quality Management
  - Focus on the customer, quality function, deployment, responsibility for quality, team problem solving, employee training, fact based management

- employee empowerment
  - invovling employees in every step from product design, to process design, and system design. Creating a workforce of empowered employees can improve employee morale, organizational efficiency, product and service quality, and ulitmiately lead to higher customer satisfaction. `
