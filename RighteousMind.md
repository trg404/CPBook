##### [Piaget](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean_Piaget) 
Piaget discovered a cognitivive developmental approach to the study of children's moral thinking.

It wasn't taught or genetically linked it was discovered as they grew up.

Continued Piaget's work 

###### the Liberal consensus

Kohlberg's work was abused and over worked it became a crutch for moral psychology. 

[Turiel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elliot_Turiel) developed an easier test than Kohlberg with yes or no answers.


Moral intuitions come first then we reason out why we have them.

## Part II

> Why do you see the speck in your neighbor's eye, but not notice the log in your own eye? You hypocrite, first take the log out of your own eye, and then you will see clearly to take the speck out of your neighbor's eye/
